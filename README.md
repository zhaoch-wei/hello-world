hello-world for github

Hi friends!

zhaoch-wei here, I create this repository for learning the github Guide.
I'm somewhat new with but interested in professional coding, while finding a free and geeklike blog is the original purpose.

For programming language,I know about shell and python, beginning interested in GO. And I'm learning and using Linux, operating and administration angle, basic server services and new cloud service like openstack and kubernetes. CentOS comes to be my base envirenment, while Ubuntu will be an alternative.
